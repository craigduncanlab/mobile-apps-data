# Mobile Apps

This repo contains data related to my mobile apps.

My first app is Match Mate (previously called Junior Cricket scorer), which is now a versatile multi-format scorer.  

It is presently available only for iOS devices.  In time, I would like to make this for other OS.

## Match Mate 

The app was written with these things in mind:

- To be as easy to use as possible (e.g. for parents of junior cricket players who volunteer to score); 
- To work easily alongside a second scorer using another method (e.g. another app or manual scoring);
- To handle some unusual combinations of match events (not all scoring apps succeed in this); and
- To use an Open Data policy.  i.e. to make the database of information in the app available for further use outside the app (e.g. visualisation and statistics).

This repository contains further information about the app and its open data.  Further data processing programs will be included here in due course.

## Programming Language

The app is written in Objective-C.  

For my own education, I thought it best to learn the 'C' way first, and consider Swift or cross-platform approaches later.  It has taught me a lot about the history of NextStep and the early decisions of Steve Jobs that live on in Apple today.
