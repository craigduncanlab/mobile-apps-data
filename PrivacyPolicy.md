## APP PRIVACY POLICY

My apps do not collect or transmit any of your personal information to me or third parties for any reason. The information you enter to use the application is stored on your local device only, to enable the app to work, and so you can keep it for later use.

If my app has a function enabling you to email some or all of the app information stored on your local device, it will use your deviceâ€™s mail application, but it will not separately record or transmit the mail information, including recipient addresses, that you use in that process.
