# Cartoon Cricket Animation 

Update (June 2021)

I've made the Junior Cricket animator available at my web page: [CartoonCricket](http://craigduncan.com.au/cartooncricket.html)

You can load in your data there, and even obtain match data for other matches to use with it.

## Match Data obtained from Junior Cricket Scorer 

The Junior Cricket Scorer app has been designed so that you can email match data to yourself or your team.

The data from Junior Cricket Scorer (and some other cricket match data) can be turned into a cricket cartoon, using the files in the 'animation' folder.

Just download the animator web page (cartooncricket.html) and open up in your browser.  It will also be able to be accessed from my web-page.

The cricket app (Junior Cricket Scorer) can send data files (.csv format) by email, and these can be saved on PC and then used with the cricket animator.  These csv files will have filenames like :

 - '3219_homeinn.csv' or
 - '3219_awayinn.csv'

NB: It does not work with the raw 'balldata' files (like '3219_H_balldata.csv').

# Match Animator (Superseded local version)

The main programs and folders that needed to be installed on your local PC were:

- loadgame.html
- media folder (containing image and sound files)
- scripts folder (containing loadgame.js and animator.js)
- matches folder (optional: to keep your match data files in a convenient location)

Put all these in the same folder, then open loadgame.html in your browser.

## Data files that can be animated

The cricket app (Junior Cricket Scorer) can email different types of email files.

The animator works with the composite match files that are generated when you email the data.  Make sure you load the correct file types when you have opened 'loadgame.html' in your browser.

These will have filenames like :
 - '3219_homeinn.csv' or
 - '3219_awayinn.csv'

NB: Animation will not work with the raw 'balldata' files (like '3219_H_balldata.csv').
