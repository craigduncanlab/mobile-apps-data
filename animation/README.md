# Junior Cricket Scorer - Some Data Applications

# Cartoon Animation 

The data from Junior Cricket Scorer (and some other cricket match data) can be turned into a cricket cartoon, using the files in the 'animation' folder.

Just download the animator web page (cartooncricket.html) and open up in your browser.  It will also be able to be accessed from my web-page.

The cricket app (Junior Cricket Scorer) can send data files (.csv format) by email, and these can be saved on PC and then used with the cricket animator.  These csv files will have filenames like :

 - '3219_homeinn.csv' or
 - '3219_awayinn.csv'

NB: It does not work with the raw 'balldata' files (like '3219_H_balldata.csv').

# Data processing (statistics)

 The raw data files used for the app can be very useful for further processing.   For example:

- I wrote a [program in R](worm2(2018).r) that will take the match scores and use it for visualisation of progressive score (like a 'worm' graph).
- I wrote another program in R that will compile all of the player statistics from the year's results.
